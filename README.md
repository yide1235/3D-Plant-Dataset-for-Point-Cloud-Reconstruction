# 3D-Plant-Model-Reconstruction
3D Plant Model Reconstruction Using Deep Learning(Zhuocheng Guo, Mingwei Sui, Yipeng Liu, Yide ma)

Objectives
• Data augmentation of 3D plant (control randomness of plant and reproduce a large dataset)
• Convert all obj files to point cloud and get them ready for point cloud Neural Network • Select the best fit model, build the model and train it with our dataset. 
• Modify the model based on the analysis of test result
• Test our model with point cloud scan of real plants
